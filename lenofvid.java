/* Write a java program for the following Scenario
You are given the length of a video in minutes. The format is mm:ss (e.g.: "02:54").

Create a function that takes the video length and return it in seconds.

Examples input /output
input      output
01:00  --> 60

13:56  --> 836

10:60  --> -1

--> The video length is given as a string.
--> If the number of seconds is 60 or over, return -1 (see example #3).
--> You may get a number of minutes over 99 (e.g. "121:49" is perfectly valid).
